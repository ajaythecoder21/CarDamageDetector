# CarDamageDetector

## Goal
- The goal of this project was to develop a way to perform multiclass image classification to detect the severity of car damages

## Tools
-  PyTorch Lightning (Image Classification)
- Pytorch (torchvision)
-  ML FLow (Experiment Tracking)
-  Resnet Pre-Trained Model (Transfer Learning)
-  Databricks (Coding Environment)


## Instructions
- Download the Car Damage Severity Images Dataset on Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/prajwalbhamere/car-damage-severity-dataset)
- Load the images dataset into Databricks into either dbfs or FileStore
- Import the CarDamageDetector.ipynb into the Databricks environment
- Setup a Databricks Cluster
- Execute the Jupyter Notebook
